    <h2>
      The Bride
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The little white bride is left alone
     With him, her lord; the guests have gone;
         The festal hall is dim.
     No jesting now, nor answering mirth.
     The hush of sleep falls on the earth
         And leaves her here with him.

     Why should there be, O little white bride,
     When the world has left you by his side,
         A tear to brim your eyes?
     Some old love-face that comes again,
     Some old love-moment sweet with pain
         Of passionate memories?

     Does your heart yearn back with last regret
     For the maiden meads of mignonette
         And the fairy-haunted wood,
     That you had not withheld from love,
     A little while, the freedom of
         Your happy maidenhood?

     Or is it but a nameless fear,
     A wordless joy, that calls the tear
         In dumb appeal to rise,
     When, looking on him where he stands,
     You yield up all into his hands,
         Pleading into his eyes?

     For days that laugh or nights that weep
     You two strike oars across the deep
         With life's tide at the brim;
     And all time's beauty, all love's grace
     Beams, little bride, upon your face
         Here, looking up at him.

      "Oh, Ask Me Not"
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Love, should I set my heart upon a crown,
      Squander my years, and gain it,
     What recompense of pleasure could I own?
      For youth's red drops would stain it.

     Much have I thought on what our lives may mean,
      And what their best endeavor,
     Seeing we may not come again to glean,
      But, losing, lose forever.

     Seeing how zealots, making choice of pain,
      From home and country parted,
     Have thought it life to leave their fellows slain,
      Their women broken-hearted;

     How teasing truth a thousand faces claims,
      As in a broken mirror,
     And what a father died for in the flames
      His own son scorns as error;

     How even they whose hearts were sweet with song
      Must quaff oblivion's potion,
     And, soon or late, their sails be lost along
      The all-surrounding ocean:

     Oh, ask me not the haven of our ships,
      Nor what flag floats above you!
     I hold you close, I kiss your sweet, sweet lips,
      And love you, love you, love you!

     When first I stood before you,
         Isabel,
     I stood there to adore you,
         In your spell;
     For all that grace composes,
     And all that beauty knows is
     Your face above the roses,
         Isabel.

     You knew the charm of flowers,
         Isabel,
     Which, like incarnate hours,
         Rose and fell
     At your bosom, glowed and gloried,
     White and pale and pink and florid,
     And you touched them with your forehead,
         Isabel.

     Amid the jest and laughter,
         Isabel,
     I saw you, and thereafter,
         Ill or well,
     There was nothing else worth seeing,
     Worth following or fleeing,
     And no reason else for being,
         Isabel.

     Some time, far hence, when Autumn sheds
      Her frost upon your hair,
     And you together sit at dusk,
      May I come to you there?
     And lightly will our hearts turn back
      To this, then distant, day
     When, while the world was clad in flowers,
      You two were wed in May.

     When we shall sit about your board
      Three old friends met again,
     Joy will be with us, but not much
      Of jest and laughter then;
     For Autumn's large content and calm,
      Like heaven's own smile, will bless
     The harvest of your happy lives
      With store of happiness.

     May you, who, flankt about with flowers,
      Will plight your faith to-day,
     Hold, evermore enthroned, the love
      Which you have crowned in May;
     And Time will sleep upon his scythe,
      The swallow rest his wing,
     Seeing that you at autumntide
      Still clasp the hands of spring.

      To Melvin Gardner: Suicide
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A flight of doves, with wanton wings,
      Flash white against the sky.
     In the leafy copse an oriole sings,
      And a robin sings hard by.
     Sun and shadow are out on the hills;
     The swallow has followed the daffodils;
     In leaf and blade, life throbs and thrills
      Through the wild, warm heart of May.

     To have seen the sun come back, to have seen
      Children again at play,
     To have heard the thrush where the woods are green
      Welcome the new-born day,
     To have felt the soft grass cool to the feet,
     To have smelt earth's incense, heavenly sweet,
     To have shared the laughter along the street,
      And, then, to have died in May!

     A thousand roses will blossom red,
      A thousand hearts be gay,
     For the summer lingers just ahead
      And June is on her way;
     The bee must bestir him to fill his cells,
     The moon and the stars will weave new spells
     Of love and the music of marriage bells&mdash;
      And, oh, to be dead in May!

     'T will not be long before they hear
      The bullbat on the hill,
     And in the valley through the dusk
      The pastoral whippoorwill.
     A few more friendly suns will call
      The bluets through the loam
     And star the lanes with buttercups
         Away down home.

     "Knee-deep!" from reedy places
      Will sing the river frogs.
     The terrapins will sun themselves
      On all the jutting logs.
     The angler's cautious oar will leave
      A trail of drifting foam
     Along the shady currents
         Away down home.

     The mocking-bird will feel again
      The glory of his wings,
     And wanton through the balmy air
      And sunshine while he sings,
     With a new cadence in his call,
      The glint-wing'd crow will roam
     From field to newly-furrowed field
         Away down home.

     When dogwood blossoms mingle
      With the maple's modest red,
     And sweet arbutus wakes at last
      From out her winter's bed,
     'T would not seem strange at all to meet
      A dryad or a gnome,
     Or Pan or Psyche in the woods
         Away down home.

     Then come with me, thou weary heart!
      Forget thy brooding ills,
     Since God has come to walk among
      His valleys and his hills!
     The mart will never miss thee,
      Nor the scholar's dusty tome,
     And the Mother waits to bless thee,
         Away down home.

     If fate had held a careless knife
      And clipped one line that drew,
     Of all the myriad lines of life,
      From Eden up to you;
     If, in the wars and wastes of time,
      One sire had met the sword,
     One mother died before her prime
      Or wed some other lord;

     And you had been the world's sweet guest
      Before or after me:
     I wonder how this rose would seem,
      Or yonder hillside cot;
     For, dear, I cannot even dream
      A world where you are not!

     Thus heaven forfends that I shall drink
      The gall that might have been,
     If aught had broken a single link
      Along the lists of men;
     And heaven forgives me, whom it loves,
      For feigning such distress:
     My heart is happiest when it proves
      Its depth of happiness.

     Enough to see you where you are,
      Radiant with maiden mirth!
     To bless whatever blessed star
      Presided o'er your birth,
     That, on this immemorial morn,
      When heaven was bending low,
     The gods were kind and you were born
      Twenty sweet years ago!

      A Secret
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A little baby went to sleep
      One night in his white bed,
     And the moon came by to take a peep
      At the little baby head.

     A wind, as wandering winds will do,
      Brought to the baby there
     Sweet smells from some quaint flower that grew
      Out on some hill somewhere.

     And wind and flower and pale moonbeam
      About the baby's bed
     Stirred and woke the funniest dream
      In the little sleepy head.

     He thought he was all sorts of things
      From a lion to a cat;
     Sometimes he thought he flew on wings,
      Or fell and fell, so that

     When morning broke he was right glad
      But much surprised to see
     Himself a soft, pink little lad
      Just like he used to be.

     I would not give this story fame
      If there were room to doubt it,
     But when he learned to talk, he came
      And told me all about it.

      The Old Bad Woman
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Old Bad Woman was coming along,
     Busily humming a sort of song.

     You could barely see, below her bonnet,
     Her chin where her long nose rested on it.

     One tooth thrust out on her lower lip,
     And she held one hand upon her hip.

     Then we went to thinking mighty fast,
     For we knew our time had come at last.

     For what we had done and didn't do
     The Old Bad Woman would put us through.

     If you cried enough to fill your hat,
     She wouldn't care; she was used to that.

     Of the jam we had eaten, she would know;
     How we ran barefooted in the snow;

     How we cried when they made us take our bath;
     How we tied the grass across the path;

     How we bound together the cat and cur&mdash;
     We couldn't deny these things to her.

     She pulled her nose up off her chin
     And blinked at us with an awful grin.

     And we almost died, becaze and because
     Her bony fingers looked like claws.

     When she came on up to where we were,
     How could we be polite to her?

     You needn't guess how she put us through.
     If you are bad, she'll visit you.

     And when she leaves and hobbles off
     You'll think that she has done enough;

     For the Old Bad Woman will and can
     Be just as bad as the Old Bad Man!

     This is the time for birds to mate;
        To-day the dove
     Will mark the ancient amorous date
        With moans of love;
     The crow will change his call to prate
        His hopes thereof.

     The starling will display the red
        That lights his wings;
     The wren will know the sweet things said
        By him who swings
     And ducks and dips his crested head
        And sings and sings.

     They are obedient to their blood,
        Nor ask a sign,
     Save buoyant air and swelling bud,
        At hands divine,
     But choose, each in the barren wood,
        His valentine.

     In caution's maze they never wait
        Until they die;
     They flock the season's open gate
        Ere time steals by.
     Love, shall we see and imitate,

     When in this room I turn in pondering pace
     And find thine eyes upon me where I stand,
     Led on, as by Enemo's silken strand,

     Framed round by silence, poised on pearl-white grace
     Of curving throat, too sweet for beaded band,
     It seems as if some wizard's magic wand
     Had wrought thee for the love of all the race.

     Dear face, that will not turn about to see
     The tulips, glorying in the casement sun,
     Or, other days, the drizzled raindrops run

     Down the damp walls, but follow only me,
     Would that Pygmalion's goddess might be won
     To change this lifeless image into thee!

      An Idyl
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Upon a gnarly, knotty limb
      That fought the current's crest,
     Where shocks of reeds peeped o'er the brim,
      Wild wasps had glued their nest.

     And in a sprawling cypress' grot,
      Sheltered and safe from flood,
     Dirt-daubers each had chosen a spot
      To shape his house of mud.

     In a warm crevice of the bark
      A basking scorpion clung,
     With bright blue tail and red-rimmed eyes
      And yellow, twinkling tongue.

     A lunging trout flashed in the sun,
      To do some petty slaughter,
     And set the spiders all a-run
      On little stilts of water.

     Toward noon upon the swamp there stole
      A deep, cathedral hush,
     Save where, from sun-splocht bough and bole,
      Sweet thrush replied to thrush.

     An angler came to cast his fly
      Beneath a baffling tree.
     I smiled, when I had caught his eye,
      And he smiled back at me.

     When stretched beside a shady elm
      I watched the dozy heat,
     Nature was moving in her realm,
      For I could hear her feet.

     O'er oft-told joys, and ghosts of ancient wrong;
     The little cares and carols that belong
      To home-hearts, and old rustic lutes and lyres,
      And spreading acres, where calm-eyed desires
     Wake with the dawn, unfevered, fair, and strong.

     If words of mine might lull the bairn to sleep,
      And tell the meaning in a mother's eyes;
     Might counsel love, and teach their eyes to weep
      Who, o'er their dead, question unanswering skies,

     Time, looking back at last, should count my life.

     Oh, I am weary, weary, weary
      Of Pan and oaten quills
     And little songs that, from the dictionary,
      Learn lore of streams and hills,
     Of studied laughter, mocking what is merry,
      And calculated thrills!

     Are we grown old and past the time of singing?
      Is ardor quenched in art
     Till art is but a formal figure, bringing
      A money-measured heart,
     Procrustean cut, and, with old echoes, ringing
      Its bells about the mart?

     The race moves on, and leaves no wildernesses
      Where rugged voices cry;
     It reads its prayer, and with set phrase it blesses
      The souls of men who die,
     And step by even step its rank progresses,
      An army marshalled by.

     If it be better so, that Babel noises,
      Losing all course and ken,
     And grief that wails and gladness that rejoices
      Should never wake again
     To shock a world of modulated voices
      And mediocre men,

     Then he is blest who wears the painted feather
      And may not turn about
     To dusks when muses romped the dewy heather
      In unrestricted rout
     And dawns when, if the stars had sung together,
      The sons of God would shout!

     But in these rhymes is always given
      A health for old Bluebritches Smith.

     Among my thoughts of what is good
      In olden times and distant lands,
     Is that do-nothing neighborhood
      Where the old cider-hogshead stands
     To welcome with its brimming gourd
      The canny crowd of kin and kith
     Who meet about the bibulous board
      Of old Bluebritches Tommy Smith.

     In years to come, when stealthy change
      Hath stolen the cider-press away
     And the gnarled orchards of the grange
      Have fallen before a slow decay,

     To dim my eye and blanch my cheek, but now
     Take me, while my lips are sweet to you
     And youth hides yet amid this hair of mine,
     Brown in the shadow, golden in the light.
     Bend down and kiss me, dying for your sake,
     Not gratefully, but sadly, love's farewell;
     And if the flowering year's oblivion
     Lend a new passion to thy life, far down
     In the dim Stygian shadows wandering,
     I will not know, but still will cherish there,
     Where no change comes, thy love upon my lips.

      Reminiscence
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     We sang old love-songs on the way
      In sad and merry snatches,
     Your fingers o'er the strings astray
      Strumming the random catches.

     And ever, as the skiff plied on
      Among the trailing willows,
     Trekking the darker deeps to shun
      The gleaming sandy shallows,

     It seemed that we had, ages gone,
      In some far summer weather,
     When this same faery moonlight shone,
      Sung these same songs together.

     And every grassy cape we passed,
      And every reedy island,
     Even the bank'd cloud in the west
      That loomed a sombre highland;

     And you, with dewmist on your hair,
      Crowned with a wreath of lilies,
     Laughing like Lalage the fair
      And tender-eyed like Phyllis:

     I know not if 't were here at home,
      By some old wizard's orders,
     Or long ago in Crete or Rome
      Or fair Provencal borders,

     But now, as when a faint flame breaks
      From out its smouldering embers,
     My heart stirs in its sleep, and wakes,
      And yet but half-remembers

     That you and I some other time
      Moved through this dream of glory,
     Like lovers in an ancient rhyme,
      A long-forgotten story.

     I would that love were subject unto law!
      Upon his person I should lay distraint
      And force him thus to answer my complaint,
     Which I, in well-considered counts, should draw.
     Not free to fly, he needs must seek some flaw
      To mar my pleading, though his heart were faint;
      Declare his counsel to me, and acquaint
     Himself with maxim, precedent, and saw.

     Ah, I could win him with authorities,
      If suing thus in such a sober court;
      Could read him many an ancient rhym'd report
     Of such sad cases, tears would fill his eyes
      And he confess a judgment, or resort
     To some well-pleasing terms of compromise!

      An Easter Hymn
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Sun has come again and fed
      The lily's lamp with light,
     And raised from dust a rose, rich red,
      And a little star-flower, white;
     He also guards the Pleiades
      And holds his planets true:
     But we&mdash;we know not which of these
      The easier task to do.

     But, since from heaven he stoops to breathe
      A flower to balmy air,
     Surely our lives are not beneath
      The kindness of his care;
     And, as he guides the blade that gropes
      Up from the barren sod,
     So, from the ashes of our hopes,
      Will beauty grow toward God.

     Whate'er thy name, O Soul of Life,&mdash;
      We know but that thou art,&mdash;
     Thou seest, through all our waste of strife,
      One groping human heart,
     Weary of words and broken sight,
      But moved with deep accord
     To worship where thy lilies light
      The altar of its Lord.

      A Christmas Hymn
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Near where the shepherds watched by night
      And heard the angels o'er them,
     The wise men saw the starry light
      Stand still at last before them.
     No armored castle there to ward
      His precious life from danger,
     But, wrapped in common cloth, our Lord
      Lay in a lowly manger.
     No booming bells proclaimed his birth,
      No armies marshalled by,
     No iron thunders shook the earth,
      No rockets clomb the sky;
     The temples builded in his name
      Were shapeless granite then,
     And all the choirs that sang his fame
      Were later breeds of men.
     But, while the world about him slept,
      Nor cared that he was born,
     One gentle face above him kept
      Its mother watch till morn;
     And, if his baby eyes could tell
      What grace and glory were,
     No roar of gun, no boom of bell
      Were worth the look of her.
     Now praise to God that ere his grace
      Was scorned and he reviled
     He looked into his mother's face,
      A little helpless child;
     And praise to God that ere men strove
      About his tomb in war
     One loved him with a mother's love,
      Nor knew a creed therefor.

     A horror of great darkness over them,
     No cloud of fire to guide and cover them,
     Beasts for the shambles, tremulous with dread,
     They crouch on alien soil among their dead.

     "Thy shield and thy exceeding great reward,"
     This was thine ancient covenant, O Lord,
     Which, sealed with mirth, these many thousand years
     Is black with blood and blotted out with tears.

     Have these not toiled through Egypt's burning sun,
     And wept beside the streams of Babylon,
     Led from thy wilderness of hill and glen
     Into a wider wilderness of men?

     Life bore them ever less of gain than loss,
     Before and since Golgotha's piteous Cross,
     And surely, now, their sorrow hath sufficed
     For all the hate that grew from love of Christ!

     Thou great God-heart, heed thou thy people's cry,
     Bare-browed and empty-handed where they die,
     Sea-sundered from wall-girt Jerusalem,
     There being no sword that wills to succor them,&mdash;

     Shrill streaks of light

     I pass a cobbler's shop along the street
      And pause a moment at the door-step, where,
     In nature's medley, piping cool and sweet,
      The songs that thrill the swamps when spring is near,
      Fly o'er the fields at fullness of the year,
     And twitter where the autumn hedges run,
     Join all the months of music into one.

     I shut my eyes:  the shy wood-thrush is there,
      And all the leaves hang still to catch his spell;
     Wrens cheep among the bushes; from somewhere
      A bluebird's tweedle passes o'er the fell;
      From rustling corn bob-white his name doth tell;
     And when the oriole sets his full heart free
     Barefooted boyhood comes again to me.

     The vision-bringer hangs upon a nail
      Before a dusty window, looking dim
     On marts where trade goes hot with box and bale;
      The sad-eyed passers have no time for him.
      His captor sits, with beaded face and grim,
     Plying a listless awl, as in a dream
     Of pastures winding by a shady stream.

     Gray bird, what spirit bides with thee unseen?
      For now, when every songster finds his love
     And makes his nest where woods are deep and green,
      Free as the winds, thy song should mock the dove.
      If I were thou, my grief in moans should move
     At thinking&mdash;otherwhere, by others' art
     Charmed and forgetful&mdash;of mine own sweetheart.

     But I, who weep when fortune seems unkind
      To prison me within a space of walls,
     When far-off grottoes hold my loves enshrined
      And every love is cruel when it calls;
      Who sulk for hills and fern-fledged waterfalls,&mdash;
     I blush to offer sorrow unto thee,
     Master of fate, scorner of destiny!

      And she, for all her mother-pains more fair,
     Is happy, seeing that all sweet thoughts that stir
     The hearts of men bear worship unto her.

     Another wanders where the cold wind blows,
      Wet-haired, with eyes that sting one like a knife.
     Homeless forever, at her bosom close
      She holds the purchase of her love and life,
      Of motherhood, unglorified as wife;
     And bitterer than the world's relentless scorn
     The knowing her child were happier never born.

     Whence are the halo and the fiery shame

     Have roted words such power to bless and blame?
      Ay, men have stained a raven from many a dove,

     The thought of old, dear things is in thine eyes,
     O, month of memories!
     Musing on days thine heart hath sorrow of,
     Old joy, dead hope, dear love,

     I see thee stand where all thy sisters meet
     To cast down at thy feet
     The garnered largess of the fruitful year,
     And on thy cheek a tear.

     Thy glory flames in every blade and leaf
     To blind the eyes of grief;
     Thy vineyards and thine orchards bend with fruit
     That sorrow may be mute;

     A hectic splendor lights thy days to sleep,
     Ere the gray dusk may creep
     Sober and sad along thy dusty ways,
     Like a lone nun, who prays;

     High and faint-heard thy passing migrant calls;
     Thy lazy lizard sprawls
     On his gray stone, and many slow winds creep
     About thy hedge, asleep;

     The sun swings farther toward his love, the south,
     To kiss her glowing mouth;
     And Death, who steals among thy purpling bowers,
     Is deeply hid in flowers.

     Would that thy streams were Lethe, and might flow
     Where lotus blossoms blow,
     And all the sweets wherewith thy riches bless
     Might hold no bitterness!

     Would, in thy beauty, we might all forget
     Dead days and old regret,
     And through thy realm might fare us forth to roam,
     Having no thought for home!

     And yet I feel, beneath thy queen's attire,
     Woven of blood and fire,
     Beneath the golden glory of thy charm
     Thy mother heart beats warm,

     And if, mayhap, a wandering child of thee,
     Weary of land and sea,
     Should turn him homeward from his dreamer's quest
     To sob upon thy breast,

     Thine arm would fold him tenderly, to prove
     How thine eyes brimmed with love,
     And thy dear hand, with all a mother's care,
     Would rest upon his hair.

     And caught and swirled away the smoke,
     But, all day long, the wooden clock
             Went on, Nic-noc, nic-noc.

     When deep at night I wake with fear,
     And shudder in the dark to hear
     The roaring storm's unguided strength,
     Peace steals into my heart at length,
     When, calm amid the shout and shock,
             I hear, Nic-noc, nic-noc.

     And all the winter long 't is I
     Who bless its sheer monotony&mdash;
     Its scorn of days, which cares no whit
     For time, except to measure it:
     The prosy, dozy, cosy clock,
             Nic-noc, nic-noc, nic-noc!

     If many years should dim my inward sight,
      Till, stirred with no emotion,
     I might stand gazing at the fall of night
      Across the gloaming ocean;

     Till storm, and sun, and night, vast with her stars,
      Would seem an oft-told story,
     And the old sorrow of heroic wars
      Be faded of its glory;

     Till, hearing, while June's roses blew their musk,
      The noise of field and city,
     The human struggle, sinking tired at dusk,
      I felt no thrill of pity;

     Till dawn should come without her old desire,
      And day brood o'er her stages,&mdash;
     O let me die, too frail for nature's hire,
      And rest a million ages.

     A century of silent suns
      Have set since he was laid on sleep,
     And now they bear with booming guns
      And streaming banners o'er the deep
     A withered skin and clammy hair
      Upon a frame of human bones:
     Whose corse?  We neither know nor care,
      Content to name it John Paul Jones.

     His dust were as another's dust;
      His bones&mdash;what boots it where they lie?
     What matter where his sword is rust,
      Or where, now dark, his eagle eye?
     No foe need fear his arm again,
      Nor love, nor praise can make him whole;
     But o'er the farthest sons of men
      Will brood the glory of his soul.

     Careless though cenotaph or tomb
      Shall tower his country's monument,
     Let banners float and cannon boom,
      A million-throated shout be spent,
     Until his widowed sea shall laugh
      With sunlight in her mantling foam,
     While, to his tomb or cenotaph,
      We bid our hero welcome home.

     Twice exiled, let his ashes rest
      At home, afar, or in the wave,
     But keep his great heart with us, lest
      Our nation's greatness find its grave;
     And, while the vast deep listens by,
      When armored wrong makes terms to right,
     Keep on our lips his proud reply,
      "Sir, I have but begun to fight!"

     To one who loved her once and knew

     A gay word, ere his tale was due

     She met a playmate, whose red rose

     Before a fireless flame,

     The downy thistle-seeds take wing,
     Nor the squirrel at his garnering.

     And yet I know that, up to God,
     The mute month holds her goldenrod,

     That clump and copse, o'errun with vines,
     Twinkle with clustered muscadines,

     And in deserted churchyard places
     Dwarf apples smile with sunburnt faces.

     I know how, ere her green is shed,
     The dogwood pranks herself with red;

     How the pale dawn, chilled through and through,
     Comes drenched and draggled with her dew;

     How all day long the sunlight seems
     As if it lit a land of dreams,

     Till evening, with her mist and cloud,
     Begins to weave her royal shroud.

     If yet, as in old Homer's land,
     Gods walk with mortals, hand in hand,

     Somewhere to-day, in this sweet weather,
     Thinkest thou not they walk together?

     Shadowed the woods and made the waters white,

     Nor the long, straight stretches of silent land,
     Nor the ploughman, that shades his eye with his hand,

     Nor the cots and hamlets that know no more

     And the fire in her heart is a red core of heat,
     That drives like a passion through forest and street,

     If I were the driver who handles her reins,
     Up hill and down hill and over the plains,

     And brace myself stooping, and give her her head,

     And urge her, and soothe her, and serve all her need,
     And exult in the thunder and thrill of her speed.

     God willed, who never needed speech,
        "Let all things be:"
     And, lo, the starry firmament
        And land and sea
     And his first thought of life that lives
        In you and me.

     His circle of eternity
        We see in part;
     Our spirits are his breath, our hearts
        Beat from his heart;
     Hence we have played as little gods
        And called it art.

     Lacking his power, we shared his dream
        Of perfect things;
     Between the tents of hope and sweet
        Rememberings
     Have sat in ashes, but our souls
        Went forth on wings.

     Where life fell short of some desire
        In you and me,
     Feeling for beauty which our eyes
        Could never see,
     Behold, from out the void we willed
        That it should be,

     And sometimes dreamed our lisping songs
        Of humanhood
     Might voice his silent harmony
        Of waste and wood,
     And he, beholding his and ours,
        Might find it good.

      Notes:
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Charles McNeill was born in Scotland County, near Laurinburg, North
      Carolina, on 26 July 1874, and died on 17 October 1907 (when he was 33
      years old). He only produced this one volume before he died, though he
      planned a second, which was published posthumously. "Songs, Merry and
      Sad", first published in Charlotte in 1906, went through at least five
      printings over more than 60 years. (This text is taken from the very first
      edition.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of McNeill's grandfathers came from Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      McNeill attended Wake Forest College, where he received both his
      Bachelor's and Master's degrees. In 1899-1900 he taught English at Mercer
      University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of his poems were published nationally as early as 1901. More of his
      poems were published by `The Charlotte Observer' starting in 1903, and in
      1904 he joined its staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      This etext was created by entering the text (manually) twice, once from
      the first printing (1906) and once from the second printing (no date), and
      comparing the two. There were some slight differences in the two
      printings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A portrait of John Charles McNeill faces the title page (p. 3) in the
      second printing, but is absent in the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first printing gives the publisher as Stone &amp; Barringer Co. and
      gives the date as 1906. The second printing gives the publisher as Stone
      Publishing Co., and gives no date. Both were printed in Charlotte, N.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      One error was corrected (the second printing also corrected this error):
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   (p. 73)
   [ A holy presence hovers round here there, ]
    changed to:
   [ A holy presence hovers round her there, ]
</pre>
    <p>
      The second printing also changed the title of the poem [ To Melvin
      Gardner: Suicide ], on p. 19, to [ To Melvin Gardner: ]&mdash;in the text,
      but not in the table of Contents. This may have been done in deference to
      the family&mdash;attitudes on suicide were once quite different than now&mdash;but
      as it has been quite some time, and the original title gives more meaning
      to the poem, it has been retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Title of the poem [ Now! ] did not have the exclamation point in the
      table of Contents. It has been added to match the text. The Title of the
      poem [ "97": The Fast Mail ] appeared as such in the text, but as ["97:"
      The Fast Mail ] in the Contents. The latter was changed to match the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the original, the book's title does not separate the Contents from the
      first poem. It has been placed there as a sort of divider.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two places ASCII fails to provide enough characters for a correct
      rendering. They are the words Provencal (the c with a cedilla) and mailed
      (the e with an acute accent, to indicate that the word is to be said with
      two syllables). These occur in "Reminiscence" and "The Rattlesnake".
    </p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
